# parameterclone
A package for BEAST2 implementing Merge and Split operators for reversible-jump markov chains selecting models with various parameter size, as seen in [1,2].

Parameterclone can be used to replicate [1] and interacts with correlatedcharacters for similar use as in [2], but lacks the Augment and Reduce operators descriped there.
